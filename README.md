# SpamFiltering
Emails have been a major form of communication over the last decade for business and personal uses.
But people are bombarded with spam emails frequently these days. This project focuses on developing a spam email filter by 
training supervised machine learning models such as Na√Øve Bayes, K- Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, decision tree etc.,
on the dataset of known spam keywords and classifying the emails as spam/non-spam. Comparing the efficiency and accuracy of different 
spam filtering models and analyzing their advantages and drawbacks is the key aspect of the project.
